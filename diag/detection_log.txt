=== COORDINATE TRANSFORMATION ANALYSIS ===
[00:06:50.657] Container (MarkersOverlay): 285.2x160.4
[00:06:50.658] Camera resolution: 1920x1080
[00:06:50.658] Detected 4 markers with IDs: [3,0,2,1]
[00:06:50.658] 
=== EXPECTED PROJECTOR MARKER POSITIONS ===
[00:06:50.658] Projector markers should be at these CAMERA coordinates:
[00:06:50.658]   - Marker 0: Should be around camera coordinates corresponding to projector position (50, 50)
[00:06:50.658]   - Marker 1: Should be around camera coordinates corresponding to projector position (1331, 50)
[00:06:50.658]   - Marker 2: Should be around camera coordinates corresponding to projector position (1331, 669)
[00:06:50.658]   - Marker 3: Should be around camera coordinates corresponding to projector position (40, 669)
[00:06:50.721] 
⚠️  NOTE: If red dots are misplaced, the camera-to-projector coordinate mapping needs calibration!
